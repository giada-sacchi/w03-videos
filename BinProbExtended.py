# Write a function which takes a list of items and a bin size as an input,
# and returns a list of lists as an output, where each sub-list represents the
# contents of one bin, as a list of items in that bin (as opposed to simply
# returning one number which is the total volume occupied in that bin).
# For example, for 2 open bins, your output could look like
# [[10, 11, 4], [11, 12, 2]], to indicate which objects are in each bin
# (which would have been [25, 24] in the video example).




# Try some of the other heuristics for the bin-packing problem. You could
# compare the packings you obtain with different methods, or use functions from
# the time module to compare their speed of execution.
